Coursework 1: Question 3

Hello! The following comments are regarding Coursework 1: Question 3.

I am an exchange student from the United States and thus the prior coursework I have done is vastly different than the prior coursework than other students (here at the University of Edinburgh). I have never really done coursework with machines and so I winged the first half of this question with the help of my friend back home. 
As for the second half of this question, I would love to come in to office hours (if possible) to discuss what it means since I am thoroughly confused. I have not completed the second half of this question and hope that this does not impact your view of me.
